Hunt and Crack Private Keys (Bytes & Hex) with CryptoSearcher
________________________________________
*Introduction*

Welcome to Crypto Searcher, a powerful script designed to hunt and crack private keys from many cryptos. This tool allows users to explore the fascinating world of cryptocurrency address generation and matching.
________________________________________

2.	Reading crypto Addresses:
o	The script reads addresses from the specified .txt file and stores them in a set for fast lookups.

3.	Address Generation Loop:
o	Generates a 24-word mnemonic using BIP-39, derives a seed, and generates a master private key using BIP-32.
o	Derives the specific private key for Ethereum addresses and checks against the provided rich address set.

4.	Logging Matches:
o	If a match is found, details (private key, mnemonic, master key) are logged to FoundMATCHAddr.txt.
o	The console displays progress messages at specified intervals.

5.	Dynamic Console Title:
o	Updates the console title to reflect the current number of generated addresses and matches found.

6.	Multiprocessing:
o	Utilizes multiple processes for concurrent address generation, improving speed and efficiency.

7.	Log Output:
o	Displays regular log messages based on the progress defined by the -v argument.

________________________________________
*Summary*

The script generates Ethereum addresses and checks them against a known list of rich addresses. If a match is found, the relevant details are saved for potential wallet recovery.

Realistic Interpretation:
Even running continuously for millions or billions of years, the chances of brute-forcing a matching Ethereum address remain extraordinarily low.
________________________________________
*Conclusion*

While this script serves as an educational tool, it's important to understand that brute-forcing private keys or addresses is not a viable method for accessing cryptocurrency funds due to the vastness of the address space.
